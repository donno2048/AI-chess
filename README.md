# AI-chess
probably the dumbest way to construct a chess AI player

you're the white player.

## How to play:

type the letter and number of the place you're going from and the letter and number of the place you're going to

if you press enter and the step you did is invalid the same board will be load again.

the computer is kinda slow at first but don't worry it will be faster...

## More information:

the specific numbers in the program have been taken from the [incredible article](http://doras.dcu.ie/17193/1/aidan_haran_20120704093656.pdf) by [Aidan Haran](https://github.com/aidanharan) where he has already tested the numbers I would specify and 'did the work for me' I chose what he called "Aggressive Personality" (page 71) because it has 27 points, while the other configurations have: -135, 11, -72 and -12 (page 83)

then, the AI train its self starting with the "Aggressive Personality" mentioned in the last parafraph
